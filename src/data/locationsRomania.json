According to The World Geography, there are a number of facts that placed her as number one on the list of eight unique waterfalls around the world due to the way the water spreads and falls in tiny shreds of water, and also the fact that it is located exactly on the 45th parallel north, at the halfway point between the Equator and the North Pole.",

      "description": "Deva is a city in Romania, in the historical region of Transylvania, on the left bank of the river Mureș. It is the capital of Hunedoara County. Its name was first recorded in 1269 as castrum Dewa. The origin of the name gave rise to controversy. It is considered that the name comes from the ancient Dacian word dava, meaning \"fortress\" (as in Pelendava, Piroboridava, or Zargidava). Other theories trace the name to a Roman Legion, the Legio II Augusta, transferred to Deva from Castrum Deva, now Chester (Deva Victrix) in Britain. János András Vistai assume the name is of old Turkic origin from the name Gyeücsa. Others assert that the name is probably of Slavic origin where Deva or Devín means \"girl\" or \"maiden\". Additionally, it is possible the name Deva was derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European dhewa (\"settlement\").\n",

      "description": "Prislop Monastery is a Romanian monastery located near the village of Silvașu de Sus in Hunedoara County. In 1564 it was built from the ground up by Zamfira, the daughter of Moise Vodă from Wallachia. It is possible that the old place, traces of which were written about in the middle of the 19th century, existed somewhere in the forest, in the vicinity of the current buildings. In the 18th century it was a Greek-Catholic monastery. In the 19th century it was almost deserted and administered by mir priests. Bishop Demetriu Radu was in charge of restoring the monastery in 1901. On October 29, 1948, with the prohibition of the United Romanian Church, the Greek-Catholic priests were arrested, and the place occupied by the Orthodox Church. On November 25, 1948, Metropolitan Nicolae Bălan transferred the monk Arsenie Boca from the Sâmbăta Monastery to Prislop, from where he was in turn arrested two years later. The monastery was rebuilt as an Orthodox monastery after 1975, with a community of nuns.",

      "description": "The Iulia Hașdeu Castle is a folly built in the form of small castle by historian and politician Bogdan Petriceicu Hașdeu in the city of Câmpina, Romania. Work on it began in 1893, after Hasdeu's daughter, Iulia Hasdeu, died at the age of 19, an event that dramatically shook Hasdeu's life. He claimed that his late daughter provided the plans for building the castle during sessions of spiritism. The building was completed in 1896. The Castle, which needed a lot of repair even when Hașdeu was alive, was affected by the First World War and in 1924 the People's Atheneum of Câmpina 'B.P.Hasdeu' tried to take it for restoration. The castle was affected again by the Second World War and stayed in a damaged state till 1955, when its name was written in the Listing of Historical Monuments. Since 1994 the Iulia Hașdeu Castle has housed the 'B.P. Hașdeu' Memorial Museum which displays furniture and personal belongings of the Hașdeu family including photos, original documents, manuscripts, Hasdeu's reviews and pictures made by Nicolae Grigorescu and Sava Henția.",

The building has a great architectural, historical, documentary and artistic value. The building, whose construction was completed in 1911, was conducted by the architect Grigore Cerchez, a prominent figure of the Neo-Romanian style, at the request of Prince Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, who was nicknamed 'Nababul' (“The Nabob”). The castle was placed on the site of an old hunting lodge that the prince's family had used as a halt during their pilgrimages to Brașov. The construction works lasted for five years, and the furnishing lasted another year and a half. At the inauguration in 1911, the castle impressed not only by its style and beauty,but also by its modern facilities in relation to those times, benefitting from electricity, sewerage system and drinking water. Until 1930, the castle served as the summer residence of the family of Prince Grigore Cantacuzino. The castle belonged to the Cantacuzino family until its nationalization in 1948, then became a sanatorium of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The castle underwent restoration work and today it is open to the public",

According to the 2011 Romanian census, there were 201,226 people living within the city limits, making it the ninth most populous in the country. The city grew beginning with the 17th century on an estate bought by Michael the Brave from the local landlords, gradually taking the place of the nearby Wallachian fairs of Târgșor, Gherghița and Bucov. Its evolution was accelerated by heavy industrialisation, with the world's first systematic petroleum refinery being opened in 1856-1857. Following massive exploitation of the oil deposits in the area, Ploiești earned the nickname of 'the Capital of Black Gold'. In the present, its economic activity is still based on oil processing, the city having four large refineries and other industries related to this branch.",

Buzău is a railway hub in south-eastern Romania, where railways that link Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania to the Black Sea coast meet. DN2, a segment of European route E85 crosses the city. Buzău's proximity to trade routes helped it develop its role as a commerce hub in older days, and as an industrial centre during the 20th century. During the Middle Ages, Buzău was a market town and Eastern Orthodox episcopal see in Wallachia. It faced a period of repeated destruction during the 17th and 18th centuries, nowadays symbolized on the city seal by the Phoenix bird. In the 19th century, after the end of that era, the city began to recover. The economy underwent industrialization, Buzău became a railway hub, and public education became available. At this time, the Communal Palace, the city's landmark building, and Crâng Park, the main recreational area, were built. The communist regime after World War II brought forced industrialization and the tripling of the city's population. Some of the factories open at the time are still functioning within the framework of market economy.",

      "description": "Tulcea was founded in the 7th century B.C. under the name of Aegyssus, mentioned in the documents of Procopius and Diodorus of Sicily (3rd century BC). In his Ex Ponto, Ovid recorded a local tradition that ascribed its name to a mythical founder, Aegisos the Caspian. After the fighting from 12-15 AD the Romans conquered the town. They rebuilt it after their plans, their technique and architectural vision, reorganizing it. The fortified town was mentioned as late as the 10th century, in documents such as Notitia Episcopatuum or De Thematibus. Under Byzantine rule beginning with the 5th century AD the town was abandoned by the first half of the 7th century due to the Barbarian invasions. The former settlement's territory fell under the rule of the Bulgarian Empire (681-c.1000; 1185-14th century). Inhabitation was restored in the second half of the 10th century, as the Byzantines built a fortress on the spot after reconquering the region. The fortress was soon destroyed in 1064 by an attack of the Uzes, however some inhabitation continued. A settlement, larger than the one in the 11th century, is archaeologically attested beginning with the 14th century. The Ottoman rule was imposed around 1420, and would last for the following four centuries.",

      "description": "Before 14th century, a small village existed in the place of today's Brăila, probably inhabited by fishermen and small merchants. The village fell to the Mongols during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and it was under direct control of the rulers of Argeș in mid-14th century. A settlement called Drinago was found in several 14th century Catalan and Castillian portolan charts (Angelino de Dalorto, 1325/1330 and Angelino Dulcert, 1339), as well as in the Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms. This may have been an erroneous transcription of Brillago, a name which was later used in 15th century traveller's journals. In Greek documents of roughly that time, the city is referred to as Proilabum or Proilava, a Greek language adaptation of its Slavic name, Brailov. In German language sources, it is mentioned as Uebereyl. The origin and meaning of the name is unknown, but it is thought to be an anthroponym. The first certain document mentioning Brăila is a privilege act, given by Vladislav I of Wallachia to German merchants of Brașov, who were exempt of customs duties when they followed the road from Brașov to the Danube via Braylan.",

Its most spectacular feature is the mud volcanoes, small volcano-shaped structures typically a few metres high caused by the eruption of mud and natural gases. As the gases erupt from 3000 metres deep towards the surface, through the underground layers of clay and water, they push up underground salty water and mud, so that they overflow through the mouths of the volcanoes, while the gas emerges as bubbles. The mud dries off at the surface, creating a relatively solid conical structure resembling a real volcano. The mud expelled by them is cold, as it comes from inside the Earth's continental crust layers, and not from the mantle.",

Men bearing the name Bakó or Bako are documented in medieval Transylvania and in 15th-century Bulgaria, but according to Victor Spinei the name itself is of Turkic - most probably of Cuman or Pecheneg - origin. Nicolae Iorga believes that the city's name is of Hungarian origin (as Adjud and Sascut). Another theory suggests that the town's name has a Slavic origin, pointing to the Proto-Slavic word byk, meaning 'ox' or 'bull', the region being very suitable for raising cattle; the term, rendered into Romanian alphabet as bâc, was probably the origin of Bâcău. In German it is known as Bakau, in Hungarian as Bákó and in Turkish as Baka.",

The lake is supplied exclusively from precipitation, therefore the degree of mineralization of the water is very low. The water purity approaches of that of distilled water, with only 0.0029 ml mineral. In winter, the lake is covered with a layer of ice of up to 1 m. The lake is part of the Mohos Nature Reserve. Near the lake there is a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Anne. Swimming in the lake in general is prohibited since April 2018.

At Câlnic, the fortress began as a residence for a Graf (count), one of the last such to be built in Transylvania. Around 1270, the nobleman Chyl of Kelling, whose family gave the village its German name, built a keep for his residence. The strong parallelepiped structure, with a ground floor and three floors for living space, came to be known as the Siegfried tower. Frequent Ottoman attacks led the keep to be fortified with a defensive level and surrounded by a massive wall. The oval precinct around the keep was fitted with a guard tower to the south and a gate tower to the north. The structure was surrounded by a water-filled moat, with access only by drawbridge. The noble owners never went along very well with the local notables, and in 1430, the final Graf sold the fortress to the villagers and moved out.",

      "description": "The cave was discovered during mining operations for the extraction of bauxite. The advance of the working front in the gallery in the Farcu mine led to the opening of a geode-type cave, a cavity with no connection to the outside. The lack of a communication path with the outside created the ideal conditions for the formation of calcite crystals. Access to the cave is through a mining gallery where an exhibition dedicated to mining is set up. Here are exhibited objects that were used in the daily work of the miners, as well as different samples of bauxite. After a visit to the mining museum, tourists will be able to look into the depths of an underground avenue, designed in such a way as to offer a spectacular perspective to the bottom of the earth. The tourist route continues towards the actual cave, which, although small, is richly decorated with crystals of various shapes.",

Operating rooms were placed at the sites of current salt lakes from the areas mentioned above. In the 17th century the first salt mining works began on the north-western slope of Valea Valea Sărată, as evidenced by shafts in the dome of the Terezia room.

It is situated in the central part of the Hășmaș Mountains, and it is part of the Cheile Bicazului-Hășmaș National Park. The gorge was excised by the waters of the river Bicaz and it serves as a passageway between the Romanian provinces of Moldavia and Transylvania. It is a noted location to see the wallcreeper, an uncommon cliff-dwelling bird. National road DN12C [ro] passes through the gorge. The road along the 8 kilometres (5 mi) of ravines, often in serpentines with rock on one side and a sheer drop on the other, is one of the most spectacular drives in the country. Also within the gorge is Lacul Roșu (the Red Lake), with its traditional cabins, hotels, and its famous lake (situated at 980 m (3,220 ft) altitude) caused by a landslide in the 19th century. Cheile Bicazului is one of the main rock climbing sites in Romania.",

      "description": "Originally a market town, hence its name, it had an important role in Moldavian culture. It was first mentioned in a late-14th century document. The name neamț is a generic name of Slavic origin for the German people in the Romanian language. This has led to speculation of a German foundation of Târgu Neamț, according to which Saxon colonists crossed the Carpathians from the Bistrița area and built a commercial township. Some Romanian historians, including Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu consider that Târgu Neamț was probably a German settlement from the 13th century, when the Teutonic Order made incursions from Transylvania against the Cumanic peoples that were living in Moldavia. Nowadays, historians disagree with this possibility mostly because of the long-lasting influences of the communist-nationalistic historiography which refused to accept the town was anything else than a Romanian-founded settlement.",
